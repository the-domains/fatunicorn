# WHO WE ARE

We are software and hardware specialists bridging the gap between digital and experiential. Sure we are wacky thinkers and come out with some off the wall stuff at times but our focus is always on the final product, the client and the KPI's set.

Nothing is impossible and we will always find a way to create something special to fit the brief. Our work is our passion and we don't work for people, rather we work with them to produce the most amazing interactive solutions ever to be placed on the earth. We are different, We are the FATUnicorn, drop by for tea, biscuits and cuddles sometime.
