# The new era of Web Development!

@FATUnicorn you are probably aware that we embrace all kinds of new technology to stay on the forefront and know what to implemnet on on our latest project. 

Web development hasn't changed much for a long time, so welcome to the FATUnicorn grid, a new era of artificially intelligent websites!

If you dont know already the Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website. As our needs grow, it evolves with us, effortlessly adapting.

Social feeds? A different layout? The Grid just takes care of it. This is not a website builder. This is your personal AI web developer. 

Its first masterpiece is the website you're looking at right now. 

So its a big leap for FATUnicorn to start using it as their site... but lets see how it goes!
